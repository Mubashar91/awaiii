    title: "The Pakistan-Afghanistan Border Situation: A Perpetual Flashpoint",
    excerpt: "The border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains one of the world's most complex and volatile frontiers. A legacy of colonial history...",
    content: `The border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains one of the world's most complex and volatile frontiers. A legacy of colonial history, the Durand Line has been a persistent source of tension, fueling disputes over sovereignty, security, and cross-border militancy.

## 1. The Historical Weight of the Durand Line

At the heart of the dispute lies the 2,640-kilometer Durand Line, drawn in 1893 by British diplomat Sir Mortimer Durand. While Pakistan views it as an international border, Afghanistan has never formally recognized it, considering it a divisive imposition that splits Pashtun and Baloch tribes.

### Why the Border Remains Contested

- Afghanistan's non-recognition of the border's legitimacy
- Ethnic and tribal affiliations that transcend the boundary
- Strategic value for non-state actors operating on both sides

## 2. The Taliban's Return and Shifting Alliances

Pakistan's relationship with the Afghan Taliban has undergone a dramatic shift. Once seen as strategic assets to counter Indian influence, the Taliban's return to power in 2021 has not yielded the stability Pakistan anticipated. Instead, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an allied but distinct militant group, has intensified its campaign against the Pakistani state from Afghan soil, leading to a severe deterioration in relations.

### The Current Stalemate

- Pakistan accuses the Afghan Taliban of providing sanctuary to the TTP
- The Taliban government denies these claims but lacks the will or capacity to act
- A cycle of cross-border shelling and temporary border closures has become the norm

## 3. The Escalating Security Crisis

The security situation along the border has reached a critical point. 2023 and 2024 have seen a significant uptick in terrorist attacks in Pakistan, many claimed by the TTP. Pakistan's response has included aerial strikes inside Afghanistan and a mass deportation drive targeting undocumented Afghans, alleging that some are involved in militancy.`,

**Common Applications:**
- Email spam detection
- Image classification
- Customer churn prediction
- Price forecasting
- Medical diagnosis

**Popular Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

Here, the algorithm works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any explicit instructions on what to look for.

**Common Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Data compression
- Feature learning

**Popular Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

        {isPending ? 'Posting...' : 'Post Comment'}
      </button>
      {state?.error && <p className="error">{state.error}</p>}
      {state?.success && <p className="success">Comment posted!</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Document Metadata Management

Native support for managing document head elements directly within components, eliminating the need for third-party solutions.

**New Metadata APIs:**
\`\`\`jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Page Title',
  description: 'Page description for SEO',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'OG Title',
    description: 'OG Description',
